#'
#' A solution is always to be accepted if it leads to a lower score. Worse solutions should be accepted with a probability given by this function.
#'
#' @param current_score Score from the current optimizing iteration (scalar value, double)
#' @param best_score Score from the current optimizing iteration (scalar value, double)
#' @param temp Current value of annealing temperature
#' @param eps Small parameter eps(ilon), achieving that not always the new solution is taken when scores are exactly equal
#'
#' @return Probability with which to accept the new score as the best one
