\title{Create a list of scoring functions (one per plate) that quantify the spatially homogeneous distribution of conditions across the plate}
\usage{
mk_plate_scoring_functions(
  batch_container,
  plate = NULL,
  row,
  column,
  group,
  p = 2,
  penalize_lines = "soft"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{batch_container}{Batch container (bc) with all columns that denote plate related information}

\item{plate}{Name of the bc column that holds the plate identifier (may be missing or NULL in case just one plate is used)}

\item{row}{Name of the bc column that holds the plate row number (integer values starting at 1)}

\item{column}{Name of the bc column that holds the plate column number (integer values starting at 1)}

\item{group}{Name of the bc column that denotes a group/condition that should be distributed on the plate}

\item{p}{p parameter for minkowski type of distance metrics. Special cases: p=1 - Manhattan distance; p=2 - Euclidean distance}

\item{penalize_lines}{How to penalize samples of the same group in one row or column of the plate. Valid options are:
'none' - there is no penalty and the pure distance metric counts, 'soft' - penalty will depend on the well distance within the
shared plate row or column, 'hard' - samples in the same row/column will score a zero distance}
}
\value{
List of scoring functions, one per plate, that calculate a real valued measure for the quality of the group distribution (the lower the better)
}
