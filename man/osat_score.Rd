\title{Compute OSAT score for sample assignment.}
\usage{
osat_score(bc, batch_vars, feature_vars, expected_dt = NULL, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bc}{\link{BatchContainer} with samples
or \code{\link[data.table:data.table]{data.table}}/\link{data.frame} where every row is a location
in a container and a sample in this location.}

\item{batch_vars}{\link{character} vector with batch variable names to take into account for the
score computation.}

\item{feature_vars}{\link{character} vector with sample variable names to take into account for
score computation.}

\item{expected_dt}{A \code{\link[data.table:data.table]{data.table}} with expected number of samples sample
variables and batch variables combination. This is not required, however it does not change
during the optimization process. So it is a good idea to cache this value.}

\item{quiet}{Do not warn about \code{NA}s in feature columns.}
}
\value{
a list with two attributes: \verb{$score} (numeric score value), \verb{$expected_dt}
(expected counts \code{data.table} for reuse)
}
