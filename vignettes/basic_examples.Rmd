This vignette demonstrates the use of the _deisngit_ package with a series 
of examples deriving from the same task, namely to randomize samples of a 
two-factor experiment into plate layouts. We shall start with the most basic
use and gradually exploring some basic yet useful utilities provided
by the package.

```{r include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6,
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(designit)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

# The samples and the conditions

Our task is to randomize samples of an in-vivo experiment with multiple conditions. Our aim is to place them in several 48-well plates.

These are the conditions:

```{r}
# conditions to use
conditions <- data.frame(
  group = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  treatment = c(
    "vehicle", "TRT1", "TRT2",
    "TRT1", "TRT2"
  ),
  dose = c(0, 25, 25, 50, 50)
)

gt::gt(conditions)
```

We will have 3 animals per group, with 4 replicates of each animal.

```{r}
# sample table
n_reps <- 4
n_animals <- 3
animals <- bind_rows(replicate(n_animals, conditions, simplify = FALSE),
  .id = "animal"
)
samples <- bind_rows(replicate(n_reps, animals, simplify = FALSE),
  .id = "replicate"
) |>
  mutate(
    SampleID = paste0(treatment, "_", animal, "_", replicate),
    AnimalID = paste0(treatment, "_", animal)
  ) |>
  mutate(dose = factor(dose))

samples |>
  head(10) |>
  arrange(animal, group, replicate) %>%
  gt::gt()
```

# Plate layout requirements

Corner wells of the plates should be left empty.
This means on a 48 well plate we can place 44 samples.
Since we have `r nrow(samples)` samples, they will fit on
`r ceiling(nrow(samples)/44)` plates.

```{r}
n_samp <- nrow(samples)
n_loc_per_plate <- 48 - 4
n_plates <- ceiling(n_samp / n_loc_per_plate)

exclude_wells <- expand.grid(plate = seq(n_plates), column = c(1, 8), row = c(1, 6))
```

# Setting up a BatchContainer object

First, we create a BatchContainer object that provides all possible locations.

```{r}
bc <- BatchContainer$new(
  dimensions = c("plate" = n_plates, "column" = 8, "row" = 6),
  exclude = exclude_wells
)
bc

bc$n_locations
bc$exclude
bc$get_locations() |> head()
```

# Moving samples

Next, we use the random assignment function to place samples to plate locations.

```{r}
bc <- assign_random(bc, samples)

bc$get_samples()
bc$get_samples(remove_empty_locations = TRUE)
```

To check the results visually, we can plot of the result using the `plot_plate` function.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5}
plot_plate(bc,
  plate = plate, column = column, row = row,
  .color = treatment, .alpha = dose
)
```
To not show empty wells, we can directly plot the sample table as well.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5}
plot_plate(bc$get_samples(remove_empty_locations = TRUE),
  plate = plate, column = column, row = row,
  .color = treatment, .alpha = dose
)
```

Sometimes we may wish to move samples, or to swap samples, or to manually 
assign some locations. To move individual samples or manually assigning all
locations we can use the `batchContainer$move_samples()` method.

To swap two or more samples, use

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5}
bc$move_samples(src = c(1L, 2L), dst = c(2L, 1L))

plot_plate(bc$get_samples(remove_empty_locations = TRUE),
  plate = plate, column = column, row = row,
  .color = treatment, .alpha = dose
)
```

To assign all samples in one go, use the option `location_assignment`.

The example below orders samples by ID and adds the empty locations afterwards

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5}
bc$move_samples(
  location_assignment = c(
    1:nrow(samples),
    rep(NA, (bc$n_locations - nrow(samples)))
  )
)

plot_plate(bc$get_samples(remove_empty_locations = TRUE, include_id = TRUE),
  plate = plate, column = column, row = row,
  .color = .sample_id
)
```


# Running an optimization

Once we have setup an initial layout, which may be suboptimal, we can optimize it in multiple ways, for instance by sample shuffling. The optimization procedure is invoked with e.g. `optimize_design`.
Here we use a simple shuffling schedule: swap 10 samples for 100 times, then swap 2 samples for 400 times.

In the context of randomization, a good layout means that known independent 
variables and/or covariates that may affect the dependent variable(s) are
as uncorrelated as possible with the layout. To evaluate how good a layout is, 
we need a scoring function, which we pass a scoring function to the
`optimize_design` function.

This function will assess how well treatment 
and dose are balanced across the two plates.

```{r}
bc <- optimize_design(bc,
  scoring = osat_score_generator(
    batch_vars = "plate",
    feature_vars = c("treatment", "dose")
  ),
  # shuffling schedule
  n_shuffle = c(rep(10, 200), rep(2, 400))
)
```

Development of the score can be viewed with

```{r, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3}
bc$plot_trace()
```

The layout after plate batching looks the following

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5}
plot_plate(bc$get_samples(remove_empty_locations = TRUE),
  plate = plate, column = column, row = row,
  .color = treatment, .alpha = dose
)
```

Looking at treatment, we see it's evenly distributed across the plates

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(
  bc$get_samples(remove_empty_locations = TRUE),
  aes(x = treatment, fill = treatment)
) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~plate)
```

# Customizing the plate layout

To properly distinguish between empty and excluded locations one can do the
following.

* Supply the BatchContainer directly;
* set `add_excluded = TRUE` and set `rename_empty = TRUE`;
* supply a custom color palette;
* excluded wells have NA values and can be colored with `na.value`.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5}
color_palette <- c(
  TRT1 = "blue", TRT2 = "purple",
  vehicle = "orange", empty = "white"
)

plot_plate(bc,
  plate = plate, column = column, row = row,
  .color = treatment, .alpha = dose,
  add_excluded = TRUE, rename_empty = TRUE
) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = color_palette, na.value = "darkgray")
```

To remove all empty wells from the plot, hand the pruned sample list
to `plot_plate` rather than the whole `BatchContainer` object.
You can still assign your own colors.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5}
plot_plate(bc$get_samples(remove_empty_locations = TRUE),
  plate = plate, column = column, row = row,
  .color = treatment, .alpha = dose
) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
```

Note: removing all empty and excluded wells will lead to omitting 
completely empty rows or columns!

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5}
plot_plate(
  bc$get_samples(remove_empty_locations = TRUE) |>
    filter(column != 2),
  plate = plate, column = column, row = row,
  .color = treatment, .alpha = dose
) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
```

# Summary

To summarize

1. In order to randomize the layout of samples from an experiment, create an 
instance of `BatchContainer` with `BatchContainer$new()`. 
2. Use functions `assign_random` and `plot_plate` to assign samples randomly
and to plot the plate layout. If necessary, you can retrieve the samples from
the BatchContainer instance `bc` with the method `bc$get_samples()`, or move
samples with the method `bc$move_samples()`.
3. The scoring function of `bc` can be set by `bc$scoring_f`. Once it is set,
we can optimize the design, for instance by shuffling the samples.
4. Various options are available to further customize the design.

Now you have already the first experience of using _designit_ for randomization,
it is time to apply the learning to your work. If you need more examples or 
if you want to understand more details of the package, please explore other
vignettes of the package as well as check out the documentations.
