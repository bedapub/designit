Description:
    This package provides a method for intelligently assigning samples to
    batches in order to reduce batch effects. Batch effects can have a
    significant impact on data analysis, especially when the assignment of
    samples to batches coincides with the contrast groups being studied. By
    defining a batch container and a scoring function that reflects the
    contrasts, this package allows users to assign samples in a way that
    minimizes the potential impact of batch effects on the comparison of
    interest.
