Description:
    Reducing batch effect by intellegently assigning samples to batches.
    Batch-effect have a strong influence in data analysis, especially when
    samples-to-batches assignent is coinciding with contrast groups.
    By defining your batch container and a scoring function reflecting
    the contrasts, you can assign samples in such a way that the potential
    batch-effect has minimal effect on the comparison of interest.
